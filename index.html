        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Narenkarthik Kesavamoorthy, a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, passionate about solving real-world challenges using IoT and software development. I enjoy building intelligent systems that bridge hardware and software—from. Outside of coding, I love playing the flute, which keeps me creative and focused. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and apply my knowledge in impactful ways.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GLOF Risk Predictor</strong>Technologies: MATLAB, Google Earth Engine, IoT Sensors
Designed and implemented a real-time Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) early warning system. The project integrates satellite imagery analysis using Google Earth Engine with on-ground IoT sensors to monitor glacier size, lake water levels, and seismic activity. MATLAB was used for processing and triggering alerts. The system helps predict and prevent flood disasters by offering live monitoring, movement tracking, and visual analytics through cloud platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>License Plate Detection System</strong>Technologies: Python, OpenCV, PyTesseract
Developed a computer vision-based number plate recognition tool that detects and displays license plate numbers in real time. The system processes live camera feed or images, applies image enhancement filters, and performs OCR-based text extraction using PyTesseract. Designed for accuracy and speed, it serves as a foundation for smart surveillance and traffic automation systems.</li>
        </ul>
